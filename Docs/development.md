# Development Insights

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Game Engine:** SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- **Animation Tool:** Piskel (for sprite animations)
- **Physics & Collision Handling:** Custom-built in C++

## Core Development Challenges

### AI & Enemy Behavior
- Implemented **vector field pathfinding** for smooth enemy movement.
- Designed **enemy aggression logic** based on raycasting for line-of-sight detection.
- Fine-tuned **enemy attack patterns** to balance difficulty.

### Combat & Status Effects
- Introduced **weapon swapping** for dynamic combat styles.
- Developed a **real-time status effect system** affecting player movement and vision.
- Balanced **attack and defense mechanics** across different difficulty levels.

### Game World & Visual Effects
- Implemented **parallax scrolling** for layered backgrounds.
- Created **real-time shadow effects** using raycasting.
- Developed a **minimap system** to track enemies and objectives.

### Performance Optimization
- Reduced **rendering overhead** by optimizing sprite batching.
- Implemented **efficient memory management** for handling multiple entities.
- Used **event-driven programming** for UI and game state transitions.

## Future Considerations
- Adding **more enemy types** and advanced AI behaviors.
- Potential release of an **extended version** based on feedback.
